Windows Authentication :
	Windows Authentication is good to use for corporate applications where the users are in the same domain.
	It authenticates with the help of the operating system and it is good for applications where the users are in the same domain.
	We can use it on corporate networks which use Azure AD groups for identity or Windows Accounts to identify users.	
	They can work with AAD groups for authorization.

	01. When we build a project, in the Change Authentication window, select Windows Authentication. 
		We can configure WA upon creation, it from the LaunchSettings.json file or from the Properties of our app, and even with the terminal.
		
	02. JUST BUILD THE PROJECT AND YOU WILL SEE YOUR WINDOWS USERNAME ON THE RIGHT. THAT'S IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	
	03. We have to configure WA in the IIS as well.
	
	It disables the Anonymous authentication and activates the Windows authentication - check this in the debug tab of your project > properties.
	The app is configured by default, meaning WI WILL NOT FIND ANY CONFIGURATION IN THE StartUp.cs file.
	WITH WINDOWS AUTHENTICATION THE [Authorize] AND THE [AllowAnonymous] ATTRIBUTES DO NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT !!!!!!!!!!!
	If both AllowAnonymous and Windows Authentication is enabled then the AllowAnonymous attribute is overriding the Authorized attribute.
